Hi all,

There are three simple tutorials on JSON using three different jars i,e Gson ,jettison and jeckson jars.
All these jars are also present under directory structure.

There are three different packages :
1. waheed.demo.pojo.json.tutorial.using.jetison
   - Conversion of xml to pojo and vice versa using jetison jars. 
   - JAXB marshalling and unmarshalling are done to convert json to xml and vice versa.
   - Just run MarshelDemo and UnMarshalDemo to check the Output.

2. waheed.demo.pojo.json.tutorial.using.jackson
   - SImple Converison of POJO to JOSN using jetison jars.
   -It will create the "filename.json" as a output.
   
3. waheed.demo.pojo.json.tutorial.using.gson
   - Simple conversion of Pojo to Json using GSon jars
   - create demo.json file under the working directory.

Note: To run it properly, Don't forget to add respective proper jars into the classpath.

Thanks
